Some explainations related to the Continious deployment(CD)
For our project,each time you commit or do a pull request.
The workflow action will generate the brand new version of the production jar files.
Two tasks are set in the configuration file of gradle.
One called player1,this task is created in order to generate the jar file for the game running.
The other called server,which can generate the jar file to set up the server.
//
Based on this,we also created two more tasks seperately runnning these two jar file.
Runserver for server,and runExecutableJar for the game. 
Right now we can easily run the game and the server by type in gradle <task_name>(working successfully).
And as we planned,we should also be able to run the game and server by simply double-click the jar files(JRE)
But sadly not,server.jar works kind of okay,the demo.jar only pops out a extremly small window with no graphic inside.
The generating process of the gradle is working quit fine,we have proved this by manually export our project as a jar file by eclipse(the same issue happnened)
We have tried to google for a possible solution for this ,but this problem is really kind of unique(it might somewhere went wrong with the src code).
Let's make a summary for this
We have CD working to generate jar files which can be easily used by the end user.one of the jar file doesn't work as we expected,But we can stil run this project by calling the tasks inside build.gradle which can excute a jar file.
